## Data Preparation

We need to first prepare the training and validation data.
The trainging data is from flicker.com.
You can download the data in [link](https://bhpan.buaa.edu.cn:443/link/5A49A835629D57929F82A2D97A6EC855)
Then you can generate the 256*256 patches using following script.
```
python data/generatePatchFlickr.py flicker_2W_images/ output_path/
```
The size of output training dataset is over 80G.

The validation data is the popular kodak dataset.
```
bash data/download_kodak.sh
```

## Training 

We provided several examples to train TSM with this repo:
For high bitrate (4096, 6144, 8192), the out_channel_N is 192 and the out_channel_M is 320 in 'config_high.json'.
For low bitrate (256, 512, 1024, 2048), the out_channel_N is 128 and the out_channel_M is 192 in 'config_low.json'.

### Details
For high bitrate of 8192, we first train from scratch as follows.

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test.py --config examples/example/config_high.json -n baseline_8192 --train flicker_path --val kodak_path
```
For other high bitrate (4096, 6144), we use the converged model of 8192 as pretrain model and set the learning rate as 1e-5.
The training iterations is set as 50w.

The low bitrate training process follows the same strategy.
